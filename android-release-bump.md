# Android Release Bump (Legacy Entry)

Canonical skill definition moved to:

- `./android-release-bump/SKILL.md`

This legacy file intentionally stays minimal to avoid duplicate context cost.

If your agent expects a single markdown file, copy `./android-release-bump/SKILL.md` and keep the `references/` folder alongside it so linked guidance remains available.
